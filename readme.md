It was an attempt to practice LUA scripting based game frameworks. love2d is a framework which runs on all patforms. Games are written in lua scripts.

The challange was to create 2d world framework with map from file, with moving creatures and meanwhile to scroll the world with keyboard and dont get things messed up.

Of course I nailed it but the code is big and OOP in lua is pain in ass.
